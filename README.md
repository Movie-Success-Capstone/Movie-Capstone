### Classification Model for Predicting Movie Success 
    
After the recent pandemic the movie industry has been slow to return to the volume that it once produced at.  Using open source movie databases, we set out to determine a movie's success based on its financial performance as well as its average viewer ratings.   Keeping an eye for any trends from previous successful movies, we then constructed a Machine Learning(ML) Model to predict the success of other movies.  
All of this can be used to help determine how to better invest in projects going forwards and what parameters can be set to lead to a healthy return on investments.

#### (a). Project Goal
    This project aims to achieve the main goal of modeling the prediction of successful movies by applications of scientific, statistical and adaptations of business logic in formation of this final model. A thorough thoughout planning phase involved several main considerations as follows:
    
#### (b). Project Description
    After the recent pandemic the movie industry has been slow to return to the volume that it once produced at. Using open source movie databases, we set out to determine a movie's success based on its financial performance as well as its average viewer ratings. Keeping an eye for any trends from previous successful movies, we then constructed a Machine Learning(ML) Model to predict the success of other movies. All of this can be used to help determine how to better invest in projects going forwards and what parameters can be set to lead to a healthy return on investments. 
    
#### (c). Methodology
    
    Plan >> Acquire >> Prepare >> Explore >> Model >> Deliver
    
#### (d). Exploration Questions of interest
    
> - Is there a relationship between budget and revenue?
> - How runtime affect movie success?
> - What are the top 5 Highest Voted Movies?
> - What are top 5 Highest profit movies?
> - Which genre has the highest profit? Or top 5?

#### (e). Target Variable 
    TARGET VARIABLE == (Revenue / (Budget * 2)) * Vote_Average

Target column == success column

The matrix that we will be using to evaluate our model contains two perspectives. First, we must make sure that the movie is a financial success.  It is not uncommon for most popular movies today to see a 100% return on investment, with revenue reaching twice of what was put into the final product. So we set this as the standard to base our expectations on. 
Secondly, we must consider a movie’s overall impression on the general public.  Film popularity is the most obvious manifestation of audience taste, and it is based upon the 'willingness-to-pay’. For this purpose we set the average rating (based on a 1-10 scale) as a multiplier for the movies financial success.  Multiplying by the rating will help any films that performed poorly in the theatres, but have gained popularity over time therefore increase the overall value of the film itself. (ex. Cult Classics)
This formula will help us rank movie’s success from negative to positive, the higher score the more successful a movie is. We decided to use score 6.5 to evaluate a movie’s success. There are about 38% of movies in our dataset that meet this criteria. This will encapsulate all fiscally successful projects, not just the critically acclaimed films at the very top.  Because the truth is that there are thousands off projects at all levels of media, and they all have the potential to generate value for those that make them. We want to capture what can help keep you in that 38% of film population.

## Data Acquisition
<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>
    
The data for this project was acquired from open-source Kaggle website- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset. This set consisted of more than 5000 data points with 28 attributes. At this time, no Application Programming Interface (API) is utelized in streamlined acquisition process due to required iMDb policies, however, in the future project updates we intend to implements APIs in simplicity of rep-producing this preject. With this stated, directly download and save locally in the same project folder the following comma-sepated files(csv):
    
- Credits.csv 
- Movies_metadata.csv
- Keywords.csv
- Ratings.csv
    
In the prepare phase in this README.md file, we will describe the joining procedure followed in the joining of these separate csv files into  of the final dataframe.

## Data Praparation 
<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>
    
The parent module for both data acquisition and preparation are included in the final)acquire module. Within the same module file, specific tasts are divided by individualized function to better enhance readability. __Wrangle_df__ function is the resultant that collectively hosts calls to the main __prep_data__ function function for the our data preparation. This function uses local data caching method to enhance data loading speeds. 

#### Prep_data function

- Drops unnecessary columns 
- Drops individual row nulls and any duplicated values 
- Applies median budget values for budget between 0 to 1,000,000
- Appends names(with whitespace) on genres columns
- Returns profitable as type bool for explorations
- Extracts nested dictionary data from columns production_company and cast
- One hot ecode data for modeling
- Feature engineer columns:
    
   * Release_year
   * Release_date
   * Profitable 
   * Success_rating [(revenue / budget) * 2] * vote_average 
   * Success 
   * Profit_amount [revenue - budget]
    
- Sets dataframe index as __id__
- Saved a __clean.csv__ file for explorations. 
- Explain variables as defined in the project through graphical data dictionary representation
   
#### Train_validate_test_split function
- Splits the dataset into train, validate, and test sets for exploration and modeling.

## Exploration 
<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

Reference to the project main goal of model prediction of movie success between 1915 t0 2017, this exploration phase was key in understanding factors that predict movie success. Guiding our predictions, the following questions were initially analyzed to determine pattern and relations among features of interest:
    
- Is there a relationship between budget and revenue?
- What are the top 5 Highest Voted Movies?
- Examining revenue, what are the top 5 highest revenue movies?
- Which top 5 movie genres that are likely to yield the highest profits?
    
#### Key Findings 
    
- Budget and revenue shows elevated corelations
- Vote count and also has hightened corellations with both revenue and profit amount
- Very little correlation between budget and success rating and also between vote average and budget
- Most voted movies are:
    
   * Minions
   * Wonder Woman
   * Beauty and the Beast
   * Baby Driver
   * Big Hero 6
    
- Top 5 most revenue generators movies are:
        
   * Avator
   * Star Wars: The Force Awakens
   * Titanic
   * The Avengers
   * Jurassic World
